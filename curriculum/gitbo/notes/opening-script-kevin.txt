-adds incentivisation options with bounties

-Gamifying open-source contributions

-Bounties portion is just a piece of the overall concept..... you are voting with your dollars.

-Owner endorsement, user upvoting, bounties - these are

-Community has a voice as to which issues are the most pressing..... thousands of upvotes may mean a more pressing than an issue with one bounty.


The concept of Gitbo comes from our collective ambition to contribute to the open source community. The open source community is awesome and there are thousands upon thousands of projects to contribute to as a developer. As new developers, we are constantly searching for ways to improve our craft. It is sometimes difficult to find the projects that are the best fit for us. Gitbo is essentially facilitating the open source community to help each other.

Gitbo creates a centralized location for developers to work towards committing on issues that really matter. We utilize incentivizaton options with monetary bounties as well as gamification to create this community of contributors.  Gitbo aggregates some of the most pressing issues from Github as well as allowing its community of users to upload the repositories and issues that are most important to them. 

At the highest level, there are 2 users on Gitbo. Someone looking to contribute to open source issues and someone who needs an issue resolved.

(need issues resolved)
The latter can be a repo owner who has wanted an issue resolved one of her repositories or a developer/technical lead/founder who uses a piece of open source software and either discovers an issue they need fixed or would love to see a new feature which will improve their experience with the software. This user can upload an issue or attach a bounty to an exisisting issue, incentivising the community to resolve this issue.

(looking to resolve issues)
As a developer, I can browse through the issues and repositories on Gitbo to find a project. I can browse for issues with a bounty attached or simply look into issues with the highest popularity index and upvotes. By fixing an issue I improve my skills, contribute to the open source community, help resolve an issue that is important to someone else, and make a little bit of cash too! As Jenya will show you in a few moments, there are several ways a user can find an issue to patch.

Extend the collaboration efforts of the ruby community to other languages and communities.

Open source software drives the ecosystem for many programming languages. As ruby developers we know just how vital the entire community of open source developers is to our daily lives.

*Inspirational statement - As developers we are always looking to contribute to open source and the community.

Github makes collaboration super easy but doesn't help with knowing what to contribute to. Thats what Gitbo does.

App aggregates all issues from Github into a place where users can find issues to contribute to.

Like Kickstarter & Hackernews for open source.

Need to explain what a bounty is. When looking for an issue to work on, you can look for important issues by the upvotes as well as bounties.

--------------------------------------------


Need to articulate what Gitbo does as soon as possible.

Issues are indipendently ranked and not by difficulty or necessary popluarity.

Good afternoon, we are Gitbo


My name is Kevin and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about how Gitbo came to form

This is Jenya and she will walk you through a short use case demonstration of our application

Next, Adam will explain some of the technical aspects behind Gitbo 

and finally, Josh will talk a bit about what is next in store for Gitbo.

As ruby developers, we all know how important open source software is to our everday lives. Open source software allows us to utilize tools which are not otherwise readily available.

The community behind open source developement is amazing. It is this community that keeps us going from day to day. Within this awesome community stands one undisputed location which hosts nearly all open source code today.... I'm obviously talking about Github.

Github is an amazing site for developers (open source or otherwise) to collaborate on software projects. One area where we have seen Github fall short is in providing an easy way for developers, especially new developers like us, to find open source projects to contribute.

Enter Gitbo. Gitbo aggregates all open source issues from Github and ranks them based on a popularity algorithm so a developer can easily find a project to make real world contribution. By providing a platform for developers to easily find and work on important issues, Gitbo helps grow the open source community as well as the skills and notoriety of the individual developer.

  ADAM THINKS I NEED TO CHEESE THIS DOWN A BIT AND MAKE MORE OF A STORY

    It is this community that keeps us going from day to day.

By providing a platform for developers to easily find and work on important issues, Gitbo helps grow the open source community as well as the skills and notoriety of the individual developer.

As if we need any more incentive, Gitbo further encourages contribution by gamifying open source contribution and rewards developers with credibility and even monetization ..... through Bounties placed on issues by repo owners or others who want to see an issue patched. I'll let Jenya take over and walk you through a use case where a developer can earn some cash and coder cred while improving her coding chops and contributing to this all too important ecosystem.
