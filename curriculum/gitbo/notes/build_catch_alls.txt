* Need to add a catch all for :owner routes so that owners in our db don't render a 500 error 

      in user controller:
        add a conditional request to github when a user show param is not found in our database to ensure that the user exists
        if they don't exist, render a show_missing_user view saying they don't exist
        otherwise render the normal show page with cached information from github.


* Need to also add a catch for repo show pages for a specific owner
      in repo controller:

        when request come in with owner and repo params
            search if they're in our db

            if not:
                poll github to see if that exists
            if it does:
                show some cached information about the repo
