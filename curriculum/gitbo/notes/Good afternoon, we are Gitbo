Good afternoon, we are Gitbo

My name is Kevin and I will tell you a little bit about how Gitbo came to form

This is Jenya and she will walk you through a short demonstration of a use case of our application

Next, Adam will explain some of the technical aspects of Gitbo 

and finally, Josh will talk a bit about what is next in store for Gitbo.

As ruby developers, we know how important open source software development is to our everday lives. Open source allows us to utilize tools which would not be as readily available.

The community behind open source developement is amazing. It is this community that keeps us going daily. There is one undisputed hub for which hosts all open source code today, that is Github.

Github is an amazing site for developers (open source or otherwise) to collaborate on software projects. Where we have seen Github fall short is in providing a resource for developers, especially new developers like us, to find open source projects to contribute.

Enter Gitbo. Gitbo aggregates all open source issues from Github and ranks them based on a popularity algorithm so a developer can easily find a project to make real world contribution. By providing a platform for developers to easily find and work on important issues, Gitbo helps grow the open source community as well as the skills of an individual developer.

As if we need any more incentive to, Gitbo further encourages contribution by gamifying open source contribution and rewards developers with credibility and even monetization through Bounties. I'll let Jenya take over and walk you through a use case where a developer can earn some cash and coder cred while improving her coding chops and contributing to this all too important ecosystem.
