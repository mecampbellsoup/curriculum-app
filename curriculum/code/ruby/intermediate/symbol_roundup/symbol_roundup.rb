# Write a method called `symbols_roundup` in Array that returns an array of all
# the symbols in the array it is called on. This method should *not modify the
# object it is called on*. 

#Then, create a method called `symbols_roundup!` that
# does the same thing as `symbols_roundup` but DOES modify the object it is
# called on. 

#Test your answer by typing `rpsec symbols_roundup_spec.rb` in your
# terminal.
