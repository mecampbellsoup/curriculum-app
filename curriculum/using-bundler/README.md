# Using Bundler

## Deliverables

Fork this repository. Deliver your solution in the master branch.

## Instructions

Follow along with the rspec test.

Using the rspec --fail-fast option will be useful since some of the
tests take a little while to run.

Make sure to read the comments above each test. There are a lot of regular
expressions in the tests, so if something seems like it should be working but
it's not, make sure that the regex isn't being picky. If it seems too picky
feel free to open up a Github issue!
