# Off to the Races

1) Given that: 
- Races have many horses through horse_races
- Races have many jockey's through jockey_races

Create a form in races/_form that will allow me to add many new horses and many new jockeys while creating a race. This form should have fields .

2) Now edit the previous form (races/_form), AND the controller, so that it will also allow me to add existing horses and jockey's to the form. You should use html checkboxes so that it's easy to add multiple existing records to the form. You'll want them all to end up in an array so you can easily itterate over them in the controller.
