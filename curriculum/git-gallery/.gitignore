# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore uploaded images
/public/uploads/upload/image/

.DS_Store
app/.DS_Store

vendor/assets/theme/.DS_Store

# Customize your seed file so everyone doesn't have to log in! See the instructions at the top
# Comment this out if you need to change the collective seed file
