#TODOs

##summary
- easy web app interface that makes finding labs at any point in the semester a breeze!
- version controlled curriculum.
- way deploy command to re-deploy previous/master labs for new semesters
- don't lose changes or work on labs due to multiple copies floating around

##endgame
1. staff can deploy new semester labs from the master/version-controlled repo

##questions/discussion for Avi
1. rethink the tag format? maybe more like deli.cio.us


NEXT:
- fix README and DEPLOY buttons/submits

- deploy-a-lab functionality
- need to get this working

- page right (index) => most recent commits
- need to apply some logic to this - which labs?

- replicate rails' rake: notes raketask

- git rid of url.txt files from the repos 
- what to do with the search bar?
